    <string name="text">In the edge (x, y) directed from x to y, the vertices x and y are called the endpoints of the edge, x the tail of the edge and y the head of the edge. The edge is said to join x and y and to be incident on x and on y. A vertex may exist in a graph and not belong to an edge. The edge (y, x) is called the inverted edge of (x, y). Multiple edges, not allowed under the definition above, are two or more edges with both the same tail and the same head.In the edge (x, y) directed from x to y, the vertices x and y are called the endpoints of the edge, x the tail of the edge and y the head of the edge.
